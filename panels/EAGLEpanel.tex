\section{Description}
The EAGLE project is really a multidisciplinary project,
which can be looked at from three different perspectives,
each one with many different facets.
\begin{itemize}
\item The epigraphy dimension, (inscriptions, transcriptions,
critical editions, translations, historical context,
geographical context, materials)
\item  The technology dimension (data model, data aggregation,
search engine, 3D representations, disambiguation,
image recognition)
\item  The application dimension (mobile application,
storytelling, virtual reality, epigraphy in schools)
\end{itemize}


In this panel, we will touch on some of those facets,
focussing more on the ones that are not going to be
presented during the conference. Our aim is to stimulate
some discussion and exchange of ideas, to try and
understand what we have missed, what could have been
done better, and what you (the audience) see as the
strong points of EAGLE.
