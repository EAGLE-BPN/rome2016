\section{Description}
This panel will discuss issues and research questions regarding the use and efficiency of digital libraries of squeezes of inscriptions—structure of online libraries, nature of the metadata, 3D digitization, and visualization methods. The panel that consists of epigraphists, digital epigraphists, and computer engineers will engage in a dialogue, addressing the above issues from different perspectives.

Digital libraries of squeezes have become an integral part in epigraphic studies and research. Whether it is the issue of collecting data for more efficient use, increasing their accessibility, or simply digitally preserving them, digital libraries are a new scholarly medium. Such projects con- front the challenge of having to determine the types of data that should be included—traditional information, digital metadata, formats and tools for articulating all the specificities of the metadata—as well as decide whether
 the type of the project should predetermine the ontology of the data.

The aforementioned primary issue begs also the question of the need for interoperability of e-libraries in an attempt to combine, contrast, and comparatively appraise and study the artifacts themselves and their metadata. Thus far several projects feature digital libraries of squeezes; howe- ver, how should one proceed about perusing them? Whether this would be facilitated by means of homogeneity of the libraries, or whether the variegated nature of the material could potentially increase the number of users and the amount of information that is available.

However, one should consider the limitations of e-libraries that focus solely on squeezes. When discussing the nature of the digital libraries’ content and the implication that the metadata may have in the interpretation of a squeeze, we need to consider its contextuality—whether the absence of the inscription bearer from a squeeze’s record may prove reductive with regards to the holistic approach to the text. However, notwithstanding that high-resolution digitization of squeezes opens the possibilities for enhanced study on a level that until now could not be achieved, techniques that focus solely on the digitization of the squeezes usually fail to deal with the inscription bearer. This panel will discuss how the digital records of squeezes could be augmented to encapsulate their contextual information.

\section{Notes}
The intent of this panel of a multifarious cohort of scholars is to pose questions that have derived from the advancements of technology and digital epigraphy research. The panel will consider possible answers and ways to utilize traditional knowledge with the advantageous flexibility of digital tools that will ultimately not only facilitate, but also enhance epigraphic studies.
